            <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go
                someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch
                in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking
                to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you
                the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? </p>

            <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular
                gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with
                it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>
